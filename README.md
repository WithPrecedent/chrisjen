"I like getting shit done." - Chrisjen Avasarala

Named after the biggest badass in The Expanse, who knew how to get things done, chrisjen provides a solid foundation for designing project workflows with simple configuration files or scripting. chrisjen understands that you want to start designing your project and not spend countless hours designing the framework for your project.

The primary goal of chrisjen is provide a simple, intuitive, extensible framework for constructing and implementing Python project workflows.

chrisjen locates all of the essential parts of a python workflow under one roof, using consistent naming conventions and structures. You start with an "idea," typically in the form of a(n) ini, toml, json, or python file, and the rest is created for you. A workflow may be built based on a variety of different designs such as:
* Contest: evaluates and selects the best workflow among several based on one or more criteria.
* Waterfall: the most basic workflow in project management which follows a pre-planned rigid workflow structure.
* Kanban: a sequential workflow with isolated stages that produces deliverables for the following stage.
* Scrum: flexible workflow structure that requires greater user control and intervention.
* Pert: workflow that focuses on efficient use of parallel resources, including identifying the critical path.
* Agile: a dynamic workflow structure that changes direction based on one or more criteria.
* Lean: an iterative workflow that maximizes efficiency based on one or more criteria.
* Survey: averages multiple workflows based on one or more criteria.
  
The Clerk class provides a flexible, extensible framework and sets of methods for all your file management needs.

chrisjen's framework supports a wide range of coding styles. You can create complex multiple inheritance structures with mixins galore or simpler, compositional objects. Even though the data structures are necessarily object-oriented, all of the tools to modify them are also available as functions, for those who prefer a more funcitonal approaching to programming.

The project is also highly documented so that users and developers and make chrisjen work with their projects. It is designed for Python coders at all levels. Beginners should be able to follow the readable code and internal documentation to understand how it works. More advanced users should find complex and tricky problems addressed through efficient code.
